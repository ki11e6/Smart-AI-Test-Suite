Prototype folder usage
======================

Developers should keep project prototypes inside this `prototype` folder, each in a dedicated, named subfolder. This helps keep experimental work organized and easy to locate.

Recommended structure
- Create a folder named with your username or project name: `prototype/<your-name-or-project>`
- Inside that folder include at minimum:
	- `README.md` — short description, status, and how to run or view the prototype
	- `src/` or `app/` — source files for the prototype
	- `assets/` — images, mock data, etc.
	- `notes.md` (optional) — design decisions, TODOs, known issues

Naming guidance
- Use a clear, unique name: `team-project`, `username-project`, or `project-name`.
- Prefer lowercase, hyphen-separated names.

Lifecycle
- Prototypes are for experimentation. When a prototype becomes part of a main project, move it to the appropriate repo or folder and remove it from `prototype`.

Questions or cleanup requests: open an issue in the repository.
